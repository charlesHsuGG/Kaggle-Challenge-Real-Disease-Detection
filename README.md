# Kaggle-Challenge-Real-Disease-Detection-TF2.0-Sample
this is simple sample for analysis and predict for real disease game

# DataSet
for dataset you can find this challenge for kaggle and download it dataset or you can create your own one.

dataset folders structure can follow as:
```
  - dataset
    -train.csv
    -test.csv
    -sample_submission.csv
```

# Expirement Result
  this expirement only using 20 epochs
  I think result can be improvement
  maybe using more model to stacking or more epochs
  
  expirement result is:
  ```
    loss:  0.5300900280475617 accuracy:  0.746875
  ```
